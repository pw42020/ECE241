Machine Learning II
    Introduction
        Neural Networks
        Recognize handwritten digits
    Data Set
        MNIST data set has 60k training images and 10k testing images
        Benchmark data set for machine learning
    Process
        Normalized to fit into 28x28 pixel bounding box
        Grey scale
        Write a program that can do this?
    Neural Network
        Create Neural Network that can learn and recognize hand-written digits
        As name says, inspired by brain
        Many NN variants exist
        Understanding basic NN is requirement to understand more complex ones
        Classic example ==> "Hello world" of Machine Learning
        Turn all pixels from 28x28 image and condense to 0-9 with percentage of how likely each number is
    Compact notation
