Lecture 1: Introduction to Data Scructures and Algorithms
    What is an algorithm?
        Well-defined computational procedure
        Takes set of values as input and produces set of values as output
        Tool to solve well defined computational problems
    A Data-Centric View of the World
        Data is import in many disciplines
            i.e. COVID data across disciplines and images, network traffic, etc.
        Past ECE focus: Processing
        New ECE focus: Data
            Data at fcore; data centers, data security, data science, etc.
        Need structured approach to handling data
    What kind of problems are solved by algorithms?
        Human Genome Project
        Internet obviously
        Commercial enterprises
    Internet
        Routing algorithms that find shortest path and adapt to changes
        Search engines that find pages with particular information
        Encrypted information
        Queue Management -- internet searches and links go into a queue so you can pull them back out
    Why Data Structures?
        Way to store and organize data
        Facilitate access and modificaiton of data
        Different data structures have strengths and weaknesses
        Better suited for a specific algorithm than others
    Data Structures and Algorithms
        Data Structures
            Representation and organization of data
    Big Data
        Extremely Large volumes of data
        Can be computationally analyzed, i.e. Internet of Things and Social Media
    Artificial Intelligence
        Often trained on big data sets
            Image recognition
            Voice recognition
        Relies on a large set of algorithm, varying in complexity
            Linear regression, stats, and probability
    Complexity Problems
        Data sets can be very large
        Operations may take a lot of time or memory
            Efficient implemenations can make a big difference
        Examples of large data sets and sizes?
            Million song data set from Columbia
                Data set of songs: title, artist, recording years, etc.
            How to find out who recorded the most songs, which song has been covered the most, etc?
